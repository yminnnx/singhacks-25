OPTIMIZED AML RISK MODEL - SUMMARY REPORT
================================================================================

MODEL INFORMATION:
   Algorithm: XGBoost (Weighted)
   Optimal Threshold: 0.20
   Training Samples: 800
   Test Samples: 200
   Features: 14

OPTIMIZATION APPROACH:
   1. Class Weight Adjustment (High-Risk:Low-Risk = 10.0:1)
   2. Threshold Optimization (Minimize Business Cost)
   3. Cost-Sensitive Learning (FN Cost = 10x, FP Cost = 1x)

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
